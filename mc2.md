# Mini Challenge 2

## Full CRUDS support for Post

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Users should be able to create new posts.
2. Users should be able to view one post at a time, through a detail view.
3. Users should be able to update existing posts.
4. Users should be able to delete existing posts.
5. Users should be able to view a list of all posts (scan).

## Notes
1. Add the links to edit and delete the post on the post's detail page (provide the post's ID as that is a urlparameter that's needed).
2. Make your site navigable! Add anchor tags to your navbar, to the list of posts and elsewhere to make sure all views can be accessed through links (anchor tags).

## Bonus
Add custom static files (css, images, JS).
